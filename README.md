# Minesweeper
i built this command line version of minesweeper from free code camp's 12 easy projects for beginners, dint realy have any issues except for the visual representation of the board
the instructor infact dint even bother showin any of that, they said that it was kinda complicated and not as important to understand for the logic of the game, i did go through
it though it included string methods to create a string representation of a 2d board. wouldnt lie much of it is me just having remembered the syntax but i tried as much as i could
to understand it again as much as i couldv, i searched for each n every line of code sepnt a lot of time and repeated me self creating this project over n over again
